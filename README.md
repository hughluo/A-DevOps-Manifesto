# A DevOps Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing and operating software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* **Cross-functional collaboration** over organizational siloization
* **Neutral measurements** over anecdote-driven decision
* **Gradual change** over batched release
* **Speeding recovery** over preventing accidents
* **Ruthless automation** over comprehensive documentation

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
